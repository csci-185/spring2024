<p>In evaluating your final project, I will take the following into account (note that different criteria apply
    differently, depending on the direction of your project):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The time/effort you put into your project</li>
    <li>Your reflection of your own learning and possible next steps</li>
    <li>The coding and design elements that you used to bring your idea to life</li>
</ul>

                    <li>Did you exhibit creativity (if applicable...some projects require more creativity than others)?
                    </li>
                    <li>Did you take any risks (e.g. try to learn something you didnâ€™t initially know how to do)?</li>
