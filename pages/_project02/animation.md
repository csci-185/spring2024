Animate one or more objects (cars, images, creatures). Pick at least three of the following effects to implement:

| Num | Task |
|--|--|
| 1 | Animate one or more of your objects. If your objects(s) move off of the screen, recreate them on the other side or have them bounce off the side. |
| 2 | Experiment with different kinds of motion. Instead of your objects moving linearly at a constant speed, you can experiment with the Math.sin and Math.cos functions (or any others techniques) to make your object oscillate, accelerate, decelerate, etc. |
| 3 | Spawn a new objects when the user either clicks or drags or right-clicks the screen. |
| 4 | Animate each of your objects so that their movement is slightly different (different speeds, different movement patterns). |
| 5 | Enable your user to control one or more of your objects using keyboard events (pressing the up/down arrow, using the spacebar, etc.) |
| 6 | Periodically add or remove objects to/from your scene. |
| 7 | When you click a objects, remove it from the screen. |
| 8 | Detect collisions, and do something interesting if any of your objects collide. |
| 9 | Enable the user to reposition an object by dragging it. |
| 10 | Create some game mechanics (space bar jumps or shoots, drag ‘flings’ an object, etc.). |
| 11 | Make your object periodically change colors. |
