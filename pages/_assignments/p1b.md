In your second deliverable, you will be converting your web page from a wireframe to a fully designed website in a style of your choice. Please read the following guidelines carefully. I have also included a list of useful tools / websites that can help you below:

## 1. Set Up
Make a copy of your `project01a` folder. Rename it to **`project01b`**
* **Tip:** Make sure you close out of all your `project01a` files in VS Code so you don't accidentally edit the wrong files.

## 2. Your Tasks
Please complete the tasks listed below:

### 2.1. Font Choices
Select the fonts you will use, and apply them to your various HTML elements using CSS. 

{:.compact}
* You must have **2 distinct fonts** -- one for your headings (h1, h2, h3), and one for the `body` tag.
* **One** of your fonts (probably the header font) **must be a Google Font**: 
    * If you don't remember how to do this, refer to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ym8GBef1YiuwanRfXkqdD55_EpgE7c4E" target="_blank">02-12 Lecture video</a> around minute 33:00.
    * Alternatively, you could also use an external font from another website (Font Squirrel, DaFont, etc.). There are probably video tutorials out there that provide guidance.
    {:.compact}
* Consider whether and how additional CSS font and text properties can also be used to create contrast and enhance usability. Check out the [Course Reference](/spring2024/css-reference/fonts/) for ideas (or google it).

### 2.2. Color Choices
Choose a set of compatible colors (typically no more than 5 unless you have a good rationale for doing so) for your visual design. Feel free to use the [color tools](#tools) above to help you create a palette.
* Once you have selected these colors, use them to style background elements, font colors, etc.
{:.compact}

### 2.3. Media Choices
Media files are one of the best ways to add visual interest to your page. Consider adding some if it makes sense for your webpage.
* If you don't have your own images, feel free to use the [stock image / video websites](#tools) above to download images.
{:.compact}

### 2.4. Composition Choices
Make sure that you're thinking about the principles of composition (proximity, alignment, contrast, asymmetry, color, and repetition) to build hierarchy and enhance usability. Feel free to revisit the slides under [Topic 6](../lectures/topic06). Some questions to ask yourself:

* Are related content / ideas grouped together?
* Is there sufficient padding / whitespace around my different groupings?
* Is color being used effectively.
* Are the fonts I've chosen readable? Are they helping the overall look-and-feel of the design?
* How am I creating contrast?
* How am I creating visual interest in my design?
* What <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv5tPZ8UjqJNYO9pCp_PQhxHT8qoGY09deKX6uygUFA/edit#heading=h.g21slfliu0b5" target="_blank">values</a> am I communicating?
{:.compact}

### 2.5. CSS Flourishes
Use at least 1 advanced CSS technique from [Topic 8](../lectures/topic08). Possible options include:

* Adding some background image effects or filters
* Adding a transition that gets triggered when the user hovers over an element or clicks on an element
* Adding a keyframe animation
{:.compact}

You may want to follow a YouTube tutorial if you're curious about implementing a particular effect. There are so many different ways to use transitions / keyframes to do interesting things.


### 2.6. Accessibility
Use the Wave Accessibility tool to generate a Wave report. Then, fix any accessibility errors that the tool identified until no errors remain. Then, take a screenshot of your Wave Report (see Sarah's example [below](#wave)).

### 2.7. Reflection
Please briefly answer the following questions (just 2-3 sentences per question) in the textarea on the Moodle:

1. How did you try to follow the principles of composition in your design?
1. What are you most proud of?
1. If you had more time, how would you enhance your current design?

### 2.8. Link to your Homepage
When you're done, update your homepage (that you made during Tutorial 3) by adding a link to the `index.html` page that you just made (for Project 1b).
