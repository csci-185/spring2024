> ## Project Guidelines
> * [Project 2 Guidelines](/spring2024/project02)

During the last few weeks of the course, you will be designing and implementing a final project of your choosing. 

## Your Task
For the first part of this assignment, you will decide what you're going to do:

1. Carefully read the [Project 2 Guidelines](/spring2024/project02):
    * Spend about an hour or so browsing the different options you have and take a look at the tutorials and starter code.
    * Read over the assignment guidelines carefully.
    * Read the rubric so that you understand the grading criteria.
2. Choose what you want to do.
3. Fill out the [Project 2a Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SCm-H1PgQOHDxmkDWUUpm04xWH5ZB88S0O0mYrvE7c/edit?usp=sharing).

## Rubric
Really, I just want to see that you put some time and effort into thinking about what you want to accomplish and what it might take to make it happen. Along these lines, I will be grading you on:

1. **Completeness**: did you answer the questions with enough detail?
2. **Evidence that you did some research** to explore what kinds of examples, tutorials, and web resouces are out there

## What to turn in
* Please copy the project proposal and answer the 5 questions. When you’re done, upload your responses to the Moodle.
* Only one proposal submission per team needed (if you’re working on a team).
