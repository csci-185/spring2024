## Overview
The goal of this week's homework is to give you practice with CSS Grid. To do this, you will complete 4 exercises. 

Homework 4 can be completed individually or in pairs. If you decide to work in pairs, you can discuss solutions and share code with your partner. That said, both people should still complete all of the exercises, commit their own files to GitHub, and and submit to the Moodle separately. If you collaborated with someone, you will just make a note of who you worked with in the comments section.

### 2. Create this layout (4 Points)

Open `02-grid`, and try to make the following layout using CSS Grid. You should not need to modify the HTML file. Note that the gridlines are just for demonstration, but they wonâ€™t actually be visible.

<img class="small" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise02.png" />

**Note:** You do NOT have to center the text inside of each section unless you want to.

### 3. Create the Taco Temple layout (4 Points)

Open `03-tacotemple`, and try to make the following layout using CSS Grid. You should only have to edit the CSS file. 

<img class="large" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple01.png" />

**A few hints:**
The `main` container is a grid with two columns -- no rows specified). See grid lines: 

<img class="large" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple02.png" />

The `section` container is also a grid with two columns. See grid lines: 

<img class="small" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple03.png" />

### 4. Create the following mobile / responsive layout (9 Points)
During [Lecture 10](../lectures/topic08), we discussed how to use CSS Grid to make the three layouts shown below. For your final task, please implement this layout (or repurpose the work you already did in class). Use media queries to implement the tablet and mobile layouts. The recommended media queries are:

```css

/* Tablet */
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    /* Your CSS here */

}

/* Phone */
@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
    /* Your CSS here */

}
```

#### Desktop Layout (3 Points)
<img class="large frame" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise04a.png" />

#### Tablet Layout (3 Points)
<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise04b.png" /> 

#### Mobile Layout (3 Points)
<img class="small frame" src="/spring2024/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise04c.png" />
