* What did the world look like before the Internet? 
    * How did people find information? Shop? Read the news? Connect with friends?
* How has the Internet changed over time?
* How are existing and emerging AI systems and algorithms shaping the current Internet?
* Why are so many people concerned about privacy on the Internet? Is it really that big a deal? 

## Assigned Readings

    * If you don't have Netflix, you can purchase the episode for $1.99 on Amazon.
