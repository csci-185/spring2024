## Overview
Today we're going to discuss the Black Mirror Episode <em>Joan Is Awful</em> as a way to consider how technological and society shape one another. Some questions to consider:
* What did the world look like before the Internet? How did people find information? Shop? Read the news? Connect with friends?
* How has the Internet changed over time?
* How are existing and emerging AI systems and algorithms shaping the current Internet?
* Why are so many people concerned about privacy on the Internet? Is it really that big a deal?
