Why did the Internet take off so quickly? Why does it look the way it does? How does the Internet reflect the same desires, interests, and curiosities (and which ones) as our offline world? Do the same systems of power that function "offline" function "online"?

## Assigned Readings
1. Watch: Black Mirror. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80195733" target="_blank">Joan is Awful</a> (2023), Season 6, Episode 1. Netflix.
    * If you don't have Netflix, you can purchase the episode for $1.99 on Amazon.
    * **Content warning:** some profanity, nudity, and irreverent scenes. But the broader point of the piece is thought-provoking.
