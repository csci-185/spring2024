## 1. Review Session
I will be hosting an optional (but recommended) review session **tomorrow (Wednesday), 5/1 in Zeis Hall, Rm. 203 (usual room) from 4:00-5:30PM**. Please come with questions if you plan to make up any of the quizzes. 

* We will be going over the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxV8F7XWrZRIdESATOs2yEc66v11I8jeWdnCI9U5MdU/edit" target="_blank">Quiz 2</a> solutions (and anything else folks have questions on).
* If you can't make the session, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lyvxwOMUve1q6noZQH6xiEF_PhQvyiX4/view" target="_blank">here is a video walkthrough</a> of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgGvsZdaL-Ff3kx6QtrJZb-xEn6o_KFWRNAJMqj9qeo/edit" target="_blank">this quiz</a> from last semester (and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MeUoT3tzid7YMllRU3hsfZQu_ZbmEw_B2U5AfW9J3tE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">solutions</a>) to help you study.
