## Assignment Guidelines
* You may work on your own or in groups of 2-3. Your work plan should be commensurate with the number of people in your group.
* You will complete (1) a project proposal and (2) a final project deliverable. 
* Your final deliverables should represent about 4-6 hours of effort (per teammate). 
* This project is not your life’s work -- it’s the beginning of a longer journey into web technologies. As such, scope your project to something reasonable. You can always build on these ideas later.
